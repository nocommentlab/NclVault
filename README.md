NclVault is an open source project written by the **!//Lab** completely in .Net Core. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

**The NclVault is under development, you could lost your data, use it and pay attention!** 

## tl;dr

We use every day more credential to access to infinite online services. Someone uses online password manager like Lastpass, someone uses offline password manager but every type of Password Manager has its weak point.

- **Online Password Manager**: there are a lot of free services that permit to store our passwords on its servers. Free... Does the online Password Manager sell my information to third part? It's secure? What happens if someone hacks the service provider server?
- **Offline Password Manger**: like Keepass, every time I need to see a credential I must turn on my PC... Ok, we can copy the database on all of our devices, but when we need to update a credential? We need to deploy the new database manually.

NclVault is completely written in ASP.Net core API and allows you to store your credentials in secure mode using the most secure algorithms.

## How it works

coming soon...
